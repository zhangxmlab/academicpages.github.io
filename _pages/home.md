“Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their time zone. People around you might seem to go ahead of you, some might seem to be behind you. But everyone is running their own race, in their own time. Life is about waiting for the right moment to act. You are very much on time, and in your time zone destiny set up for you.”

We are interested in topics of land management, landscape ecology, ecosystem services, and environmental pollution. Our research focuses on better understanding ecosystem services, their distributions and impacts, and their interactions with humans and nature. Besides, we are also interested in exploring the most pressing environmental issues (e.g., carbon emission) and their sustainability relationship with our urbanizing planet.
